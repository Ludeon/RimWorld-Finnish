    <AllowedAreas.helpText>Colonists and colony animals can be assigned to ALLOWED AREAS. This forbids them from taking destinations outside their allowed area.\n\nThis can be used to, for example, forbid colonists from going outside.\n\nYou can create multiple allowed areas and assign them to different colonists and animals.\n\nCreate, delete, and assign allowed areas in the RESTRICT tab.\n\nPaint allowed areas onto the map using the EXPAND ALLOWED AREA and CLEAR ALLOWED AREA designators in the Architect tab.</AllowedAreas.helpText>

    <CoverAndShooting.helpText>The most important thing to do in ranged combat is to use cover.\n\nCover only works if your colonist is touching it, and it is between your colonist and the enemy.\n\nYou can also place colonists behind wall corners. They will lean out to shoot.\n\nMost things can be used as cover, but some things are better than others. Hiding behind a tree is better than nothing, but hiding behind sandbags is better than using a tree.</CoverAndShooting.helpText>
    <CoverAndShooting.label>Cover and shooting</CoverAndShooting.label>

    <FirePreparation.helpText>Fires can easily burn down a colony. To defeat them, you must prepare before they happen.
\nThese design elements can help reduce the damage from fires:
\n1. Instead of constructing one super-building, build separate buildings with spaces in between.
\n2. Use less flammable materials. Wood is cheap and fast - but very flammable.
\n3. Build firebreaks to stop wildfires approaching your base. A strip of concrete floor 3 or 4 cells wide will generally stop an advancing fire.</FirePreparation.helpText>
    <FirePreparation.label>Fire preparation</FirePreparation.label>
    <Forbidding.helpText>Colonists will not interact with items marked FORBIDDEN.\n\nForbidden items have a small red X attached. Select a forbidden item and use the controls at the bottom to UNFORBID it.</Forbidding.helpText>
    <ForbiddingDoors.helpText>You can FORBID doors so colonists and tame animals won't go through them.\n\nNote that this isn't a door lock. Doors are always locked, so enemies can't pass freely. Forbidding just directs your colonists not to use the door. Colonists who are going crazy might use the door anyway.</ForbiddingDoors.helpText>
    <ForbiddingDoors.label>Forbidding doors</ForbiddingDoors.label>
    <FormCaravan.helpText>You can form a caravan to send groups of people traveling across the planet!\n\nIn the WORLD tab, select your home base and click the "form caravan" button.</FormCaravan.helpText>
    <FormCaravan.label>Forming caravans</FormCaravan.label>
    <FriendlyFireSafety.helpText>Friendly fire never occurs if the shooter is close to their ally.\n\nFor example, you can safely put a sword-wielding colonist directly in front of a gun-wielding one. The shooter will fire over his friend's shoulder.\n\nThis is a good way to combine ranged and melee fighters.</FriendlyFireSafety.helpText>
    <FriendlyFireSafety.label>Friendly fire safety</FriendlyFireSafety.label>

    <ManualWorkPriorities.helpText>One of the most important parts of RimWorld is choosing good work settings for your colonists.\n\nPoor work settings can leave essential work unfinished for a long time while colonists waste time on unimportant tasks.\n\nTo give more control over what work colonists do, you can use the Manual Priorities mode in the WORK tab.\n\nIn this mode, each colonist has a priority number for each work type. Colonists will do priority 1 work from left to right, then priority 2 work from left to right, and so on.\n\nIntelligent use of these setting is essential for a large, well-automated colony.</ManualWorkPriorities.helpText>
    <ManualWorkPriorities.label>Manual work priorities</ManualWorkPriorities.label>
    <MedicalOperations.helpText>To assign a medical operation, like organ harvesting or prosthetics installation, open a colonist's HEALTH tab, then switch to the OPERATIONS sub-tab.</MedicalOperations.helpText>
    <Mining.helpText>You can designate where to mine by opening the ARCHITECT menu and selecting the ORDERS tab.\n\nSome mineable blocks yield STEEL, GOLD, PLASTEEL, and other useful materials.</Mining.helpText>
    <Outfits.helpText>Colonists will automatically try to wear the newest, highest-quality apparel they can.\n\nYou don't need to manually assign each piece of apparel to colonists (though you can, if you wish).\n\nTo assign colonists restrictions on how to dress, open the ASSIGN tab, use the "Manage outfits" dialog box to design a new outfit, and then assign the outfit to colonists.</Outfits.helpText>

    <ShotAccuracyTooltip.helpText>You can see the exact calculations behind the accuracy of any shot.\n\nTo do so, select the shooter, then rest the mouse over the target. The tooltip will show the chance to hit, and a breakdown of the contribution of various to-hit chance multipliers.</ShotAccuracyTooltip.helpText>
    <ShotAccuracyTooltip.label>Shot accuracy tooltip</ShotAccuracyTooltip.label>
    <SpoilageAndFreezers.helpText>Most foodstuffs will spoil after a relatively short time.\n\nTo prevent this, you can build a walk-in freezer.\n\nTo build a freezer, construct a closed room, and put one or two coolers into the wall. Set the coolers to a negative target temperature.\n\nFrozen foods won't ever spoil.</SpoilageAndFreezers.helpText>
    <SpoilageAndFreezers.label>Spoilage and freezers</SpoilageAndFreezers.label>

    <StorageTab.helpText>You can configure stockpiles and storage buildings by selecting them and opening the STORAGE TAB above the bottom-left inspector pane.\n\nIn the storage tab of a stockpile, you can expand categories to allow or deny specific items. Click the triangles to the left of category names.\n\nYou can change the PRIORITY of storage. Colonists will fill higher-priority storage first, and move items from lower to higher priority.</StorageTab.helpText>
    <TimeAssignments.helpText>You can modify what time of day colonists should do different activities using the RESTRICT tab.</TimeAssignments.helpText>
    <TimeAssignments.label>Time assignments</TimeAssignments.label>
    <TimeControls.helpText>You can speed up time.\n\nTry controlling time with the {Key:TimeSpeedNormal}, {Key:TimeSpeedFast}, and {Key:TimeSpeedSuperfast} keys, or with the time controls in the bottom right.</TimeControls.helpText>
    <WorkTab.helpText>You can set each colonist's work settings in the WORK tab at the bottom left of the screen.\n\nThey will always do the highest priority work that they can find.\n\nIf nobody has a certain work type assigned, or if they are busy with higher-priority tasks, it will never get done.</WorkTab.helpText>

    <MaxNumberOfPlayerHomes.helpText>Warning: RimWorld is designed to be played with one player colony at a time. Though it is possible to have more colonies, this will probably cause performance slowdowns and gameplay imbalances. We recommend that, at least at first, you play the game with a one colony maximum.</MaxNumberOfPlayerHomes.helpText>

    <SwitchFlickingDesignation.helpText>Note: This only designates that a colonist should flick the switch.\n\nNothing will actually happen until a colonist (with the Flicker work type) comes and flicks the switch by hand.</SwitchFlickingDesignation.helpText>
